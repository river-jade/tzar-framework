The version of the JCommander is a patched version to fix a bug in the parser.
I've changed line 23 of JCommand.java from:

String[] sp = arg.split("[" + sep + "]");

to

String[] sp = arg.split("[" + sep + "]", 2);

in order to support arguments of the form:
--commandlineargs="a=b c=d d=f"

I've filed a bug with the author and submitted this fix as a suggestion.
Hopefully he'll fold it into the trunk.
